🗨️ Basic Chat Application (MERN Stack)
This is a simple, functional chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to log in and out and retains chat history without the need for authentication.

✨ Key Features
User Access: Users can log in and out of the chat without any authentication.
Persistent Chat History: Chat messages are stored in a database, ensuring the conversation history is preserved across sessions.
MERN Stack: Built using MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and Node.js to tie everything together.
🛠️ Technologies Used
React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
Redux: For state management.
Express.js: Backend framework for handling server logic.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime used on the server.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing chat messages.
Socket.io: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
